# Contributing to Conway's Game of Life in TypeScript

One of the aims of this project is to learn how best to implement a simple application in various languages which touches on the subject of variables, data structures, program flow and test- or behaviour-driven development.

With that in mind, potential contributors are encouraged to make suggestions on how to improve this repository to get it more in line with community guidelines or convention within the TypeScript programming community, and to make better use of the languages features.

If you do make any changes, however, please ensure that the tests are still passing before you make a pull request.

Thank you!
